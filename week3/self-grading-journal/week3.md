# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

Challenged by time as i have test leftover from the last courses due to being ill, so had to balance focus between these materials and java materials.
Strugled a bit with the programming of the creditcard template in the group programming.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Feel like a could get through the material and do all the required labs well enough.

- Key Learning:
  > - REACT projects and how to crete them.
  > - Postman utilization to test basic CRUD operations on and express server
  > - SCRUM - INVEST and DEEP methodologies

### Online Resources:

I've used the online resources provided by the class, and then some other videos about this weeks classes, such ase using figma and trello.

### Coping Strategies:
- Academic Progress:  
I did all the assigned homework, but no grades were being assigned.
I feel like i've not improved much though, just small steps towards MERN stack knowledge.

- Soft Skills Development:

I feel like i can better allow people to do things their own way and trust things will still get don well.

### Project Management:

Agile project management helped better with staying in touch with my teammates and we have a better understanding of whats going on with the group and the project.

### Final Thoughts:

This premade text below pretty much sums it up.  
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps:
 I'll go on to the next week with an open mind.
