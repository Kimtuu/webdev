# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

Hopefully i passed the previous classes test and can continue to give my full academic attention to these two courses.
Personally i feel like i still struggle with the creation of code, i feel like i cant write many lines without some reference of content that already excists.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Pair programming went well and i really like the interaction part of it even though i might at times struggle with the actual coding part, but with a pair I feel like we are able to hash thing out to a decent form.

- Key Learning:
  > - React use of midleware to handle res and reqs' mainly we use some error handling midleware and some to concert data to json form.
  >
  > - Brief part on the MVC model, but i would still like to see a real life example of a well structured MVC model in web design.
  > - Learned a bit about pair programming and a little about its use cases.

### Online Resources:

Watched a lot of youtube videos about creating different react front-end components.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:  
  Finally got some needed self reassurance from another classes grade of 4.

- Soft Skills Development:

I feel like i can better allow people to do things their own way and trust things will still get don well.

### Project Management:

We met a few times and planned what each members was to do, but it would seem like some members are really short on time for this project sadly. hopefully next week we have more time to allocate to the project.

### Final Thoughts:

A decent week, would've like more comm's about our plans for this weeks goals as a group.

### Next Steps:

Keep on with the classes and try to learn more about how to creat web apps. Also i need to take time to learn how to combine the front and backend with the functionalities of a web app.
