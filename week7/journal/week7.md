# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

Was in an operation this week and it was tough to create anything due to being drained from the operation for couple days and energy levels haven't been too good. 

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Teamwork went smoothly and mos of us were some wae or another under the weather, but still managed to forward the project.

- Key Learning:
  > - React useReducer and useContext hooks
  > - authorization finalization
  > - javascript testing with Jest and Mocha
  > -

### Online Resources:

re-built the homework videos apps in full to get a good handle of the properties a full app needs to work and use authentication.

### Coping Strategies:

- Tough week due to need of rest and low energy, so need to pick it up again next week so we can deliver a quality product by the end of the month

- 

### Project Management:

we've discussed about the project management and we can see the holes that were starting way back in the design part, where some things change due to lack of time/knowledge.

### Final Thoughts:

Struggling week, need to step it up on my own part for week 8.

### Next Steps:

Try and create some positive routines to get more efficient and staying on time with tasks.
Continue on the above path and maybe try to implement a healthier time routine so can also have time for my self.
