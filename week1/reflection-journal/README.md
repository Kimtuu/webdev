### Insights

**_Not_** really sure as of yet how to implement these parts to a production unit.

**_But_** got a some what good grasp on how to create a local server that runs the node javascript (locally)
**_and_** got somewhat familiar with ubuntus bash and how to utilize it to create projects and run git, npm and vsc through it
