# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

It was hard to create a working posting form due to all the different layers that are needed to be built to get the message go from the user to the backend and back to the user.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

discovered some of the basics of what it means to get data from user to user trough abkcend

- Key Learning:
  > - MERN auth and user states
  > - JWT usage to authorize users
  > - bcrypt to hash passwords for data safety in case of breaches
  > -

### Online Resources:

Googling for issues and watching videos related to the issues at hand. also stackoverflow came through bigtime.
Same apply, this time i emphasized even more to youtube videos to learn about auth, i watched Net ninjas MERN and MERN auth video series fully to get a grasp on what is supposed to be done for a good project.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress: learned more about the mindset of a coder and what it takes to learn things and be ok with not knowing everything.

- Soft Skills Development:
  Mindset adjustment but always still more room to improve

### Project Management:

I studied a lot on the parts that i was tasked to create and create some plans as how to implement them to the project

### Final Thoughts:

Great week on the part of studying, really took the time to watch and learn. Next week shall be more about implementation to own project.

### Next Steps:

Try and create some positive routines to get more efficient and staying on time with tasks.
Continue on the above path and maybe try to implement a healthier time routine so can also have time for my self.
