# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

Faced many challenges with motivation and brainfog.
Strugled sometimes to even complete given homework ontime and also with project components.

Group faced challenges in the merging of the files from git using the vscodes merging.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Again I enjoyed the pairprogramming, even though I might have strugled a bit with the coding itself.

- Key Learning:
  > - Mongoose basics of how to create a mogoDb and connect to it via using mongoose.
  >
  > - Async await and its usecases
  > - useState Hooks and react routing to create a SPA

### Online Resources:

Googling for issues and watching videos related to the issues at hand. also stackoverflow came through bigtime.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

- Soft Skills Development:

I feel like i can better allow people to do things their own way and trust things will still get don well.

### Project Management:

On my own part, i did accomplish the set goals, but I strugled with keeping up with the group scrums.

### Final Thoughts:

A rough week, definitely wanting a better week for next week.

### Next Steps:

Try and create some positive routines to get more efficient and staying on time with tasks.
