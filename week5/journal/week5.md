# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:

Faced challenges with the use of website, how to catercorize each user level and show them the different pages dependent on the user state.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about MERN authorization when it comes to user authorization and logging in.

- Key Learning:
  > - MERN auth and user states
  > - JWT usage to authorize users
  > - bcrypt to hash passwords for data safety in case of breaches
  > -

### Online Resources:

Googling for issues and watching videos related to the issues at hand. also stackoverflow came through bigtime.
Same apply, this time i emphasized even more to youtube videos to learn about auth, i watched Net ninjas MERN and MERN auth video series fully to get a grasp on what is supposed to be done for a good project.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress: Learned more about the power of opensource material and how beneficial it is in coding world as a tool to source knowledge from.

- Soft Skills Development:
  Leaned to take touchy subjects head on and not try to side step them, even if it would at first seem easier to just let things be left spoken.

### Project Management:

I studied a lot on the parts that i was tasked to create and create some plans as how to implement them to the project

### Final Thoughts:

Great week on the part of studying, really took the time to watch and learn. Next week shall be more about implementation to own project.

### Next Steps:

Try and create some positive routines to get more efficient and staying on time with tasks.
Continue on the above path and maybe try to implement a healthier time routine so can also have time for my self.
